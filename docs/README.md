# BhuChain: Blockchain-Based Land Registration System

BhuChain is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to modernize land registration in Nepal. By leveraging Ethereum blockchain technology and a hybrid data management strategy, the system provides a tamper-proof "Source of Truth" for land ownership while ensuring high performance and user privacy.

## 🛠 Technology Stack (Requirement Analysis)

1. **Immutable Ownership Ledger:** Solidity & Ethereum (Hardhat)
2. **Secure Data & API Services:** Django & Python (PostgreSQL)
3. **User Experience:** React.js & Vite
4. **Identity & Authorization:** MetaMask

## 📂 Project Structure

- **backend/**: Django REST Framework API and off-chain data management.
- **frontend/**: React.js application for citizens and administrators.
- **smart_contracts/**: Solidity source code and Hardhat environment.
- **docs/**: Technical memory, project proposal, and task lists.

## 🧠 Technical Memory (Implementation Guide)

Before starting implementation, refer to these finalized design blueprints:

- [Architecture Blueprint](docs/tech_architecture.md): The Hybrid system design.
- [Smart Contract Spec](docs/smart_contract_spec.md): Solidity variables and logic.
- [Backend & DB Spec](docs/backend_and_database.md): Django and PostgreSQL schema.
- [Frontend & UX Flow](docs/frontend_and_ux.md): User journeys and UI requirements.

## 🚀 Getting Started

The project is currently transitioning into **Phase 2: System Development**.

Refer to [docs/proposal.md](docs/proposal.md) for full technical requirements and [task.md](task.md) for the active development checklist.
